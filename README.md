# Summary

This is the first project that I put together since joining the Software Development Mastermind Mentorship. I did not know much about coding coming in but I was able to use the resources given to me to learn the fundamentals to be able to put this together. It took me some time to go through the material and understand what is going on behind this application. With the help of the team of mentors I have, I managed to problem solve my way through it. 

It was challenging for me to understand how to toggle the button to show the information I needed it to. It was a fun problem to solve and look forward to more of it!
